Hi,

I'm a french SRE / DevOps / CloudOps / System & Network Engineer / Architect, working in the infrastructure team of Radio France called "Fondation".
We are hosting the websites and building the streaming platform with open source technologies.

I'm also an audiovisual creator and musician performing under the name SCHEMATiC WiZARD. Producing various stuff since 2010, but now trying to focus on modular synthesis, livecoding with obsolete technologies like Minitel, IDM music and an obscure creative experiment/framework called Bill of Materials.
